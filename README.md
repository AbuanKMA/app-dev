**Coraline**

**Description**
*Coraline Jones, a young adventurous girl, moves to a new home with her busy parents. Feeling bored and neglected, Coraline discovers a small door that seems to lead to a brick wall, but at night it becomes a portal to an alternate world. In this alternate world, everything is perfect, and Coraline finds herself with doppelgängers of her real parents who are attentive and loving. Additionally, there is a beautiful garden full of talking animals and colorful scenery.*

*As Coraline spends more time in the alternate world, she realizes that the Other Mother, who rules over this world, is not what she seems. The Other Mother soon makes demands of Coraline and tries to trap her in this world forever. Coraline learns that the Other Mother plans to sew buttons over her eyes, so she will never want to leave this world.*

*With the help of a mysterious talking cat, Coraline tries to escape the Other Mother’s clutches and return to her own world. However, as things start to unravel and the Other Mother pursues her, Coraline must use her wits and bravery to save herself, her parents, and the souls of three children who have been trapped in the Other Mother’s world for years.*

*In the end, Coraline emerges victorious and destroys the Other Mother. She returns to her own world, where everything is much as it was before, but with the promise of a brighter future. Coraline is left with a newfound appreciation for her family and an understanding that there is not always an easy way out of problems.*
